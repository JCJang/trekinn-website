    "p1":"No matter where you travel in Hualien, one of the best natural getaways in Taiwan,《Trekinn》 is the perfect choice to stay for comfort and convenience. Price-conscious travelers would find, though our low room rates, we give good service and amenities they want and expect. Whole building is air-conditioned well by the Mitsubishi's ventilation system at low DB values. Heat-pump water heating design makes sure guests can enjoy Massage shower anytime. Each room has one or two clean double beds, TV with various HD channels in English, free selective drinks, and closets with well arranged shelves. Just log in and you would surf Internet with WiFi. Clean work is so cared by our staff, and that is base of our core values.",
    "p2":"《Trekinn》 is in the neighborhood of the Hualien Golf Club, and you can have fun in there without membership. Bikes are here for our guests without charge. It's about 10 minutes to seashore by bikes, and 10 minutes more to the downtown for Starbucks or local cuisines. Parkview hotel is steps away and you may have a good meal there. Anyway, it's not a good idea to pay much for swimming and funs inside there. So lodge at 《Trekinn》 and go out for mountainous beauty of the Taroko Gorge, out-of-coast whale and dolphin watching, scenic spots on the road number 9 along the mountain side and the 11 along the eastern Pacific coast.",
    "p3":"Package tours are available for half or one day long without worry about transportation. However, it seems better to drive a vehicle traveling around wild Hualien if travel information is collected well before you hit the road. Surely we can assist you if help is needed.《Trekinn》 is small but nicely laid out for quiet stay in city area. You may make a call to contact us for reservation. Leaving messages on our web site's contact zone or email to us is preferred for complete answers. The promotional programs and the discounted rates at each season are put on the bulletin. We look forward to having you as our guest and making your stay comfortable and enjoyable.",
    "p4":"《 美崙遊記 》是花蓮市區合法民宿，不是MOTEL也不是HOTEL，沒有閒雜人等。我們沒有營造一堆特色，因為特色留給花蓮，尤其是寬闊的東岸大自然景觀及悠閒的人文風情。"
